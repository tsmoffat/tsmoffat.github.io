<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-dev-to">Some thoughts on dev.to</h2>

<p>After a few weeks of reading dev.to, what I&rsquo;ve learned is that there&rsquo;s so many people there that are completely up themselves (which sometimes includes me). This sucks. Dev.to is a great idea, and the people who run it are completely lovely, however there&rsquo;s people on there who are just so willing to peacock themselves that they forget what the point of the website is, which is to foster discussion. Eminent examples from just the last few days include the guy who is writing a new internet and seems to think that his one man implementation will be able to beat the monolith that is the current internet. There was also the guy who started a discussion asking why people though PHP was bad, then not actually listening to anyone and just arguing, discounting other people&rsquo;s opinions and generally acting in bad faith about the whole thing.</p>

<p>The new devs who write about five lines about their first git push are annoying but at least are new so it&rsquo;s understandable. It&rsquo;s the guys who claim they&rsquo;ve solved P=NP or something similar, and then when they get told to put up or shut up do neither (see also: Guys who claim to have picked a Protec2 lock, which is almost undoable, at least at the moment).</p>

<p>Dev.to has the same problem as Reddit and pretty much every other website out there with comments of some description turned on: the content is often great, if slightly banal, yet the people who comment there have an inflated sense of their own self-importance (and I am aware of the irony that I sound like a pompous git while complaining about this).</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-golang">Some thoughts on Golang</h2>

<p>This has fast become my new favourite programming language. It&rsquo;s powerful as all hell and fast to boot. Yet it&rsquo;s not full of all the bloat you might find normally in other powerful and fast languages such as C or C++, etc. The fact that it&rsquo;s really simple to start up a webserver is amazing as well, as is the concurrency.</p>

<p>I think this is going to be what I write all of my code in for my personal projects in the future. This website as well is running on Huge, which is written in Go. Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t much scope to write with it at work, unless I happen to have some downtime.</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-the-lamp-stack">Some thoughts on the LAMP Stack</h2>

<p>The LAMP stack (or Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) is terrible. Completely horrible. I was setting up a server to run a PHP app recently and it took me literally about 16 hours to get it working properly. This shouldn&rsquo;t happen with a piece of software. At the end of it all, I finally found the one StackOverflow answer that helped me, which I&rsquo;m going to reproduce here, just in case.</p>

<pre><code>use mysql;
update user set authentication_string=PASSWORD(&quot;&quot;) where User='root';//make sure to set the auth plugin to mysql_native_password
update user set plugin=&quot;mysql_native_password&quot; where User='root';
flush privileges;
quit;
</code></pre>

<p>Before this run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
sudo mysqld_safe
mysql -uroot
</code></pre>

<p>And after:</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
mysql -u root -p
</code></pre>

<p>And if the terminal gives the sock error then use:</p>

<pre><code>mysql -uroot -h127.0.0.1 -p
</code></pre>

<p>This should work, however it&rsquo;s an incredible amount of faff for what should be such a simple task. As much as I hate JavaScript, I think it&rsquo;s miles better than LAMP, as it means I can actually set up the server quickly with minimal effort on my part, whether I&rsquo;m using NGINX or a Go http handler. Even better would be Django or (surprise surprise) Hugo, as Go can be cross-compiled to JS if needed.</p>
