      <description>Some thoughts on dev.to After a few weeks of reading dev.to, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that there&amp;rsquo;s so many people there that are completely up themselves (which sometimes includes me). This sucks. Dev.to is a great idea, and the people who run it are completely lovely, however there&amp;rsquo;s people on there who are just so willing to peacock themselves that they forget what the point of the website is, which is to foster discussion.</description>
